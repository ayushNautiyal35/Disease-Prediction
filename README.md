# Disease-Prediction
Multiple disease is predicted according to the symptoms and the python tkinter is use for GUI
# PROBLEM STATEMENT -   Creating Graphic User Interface for prediction of disease using Python Tkinter.

# Motivation-  
Disease prediction find solution to many problems which are :
•	It is beneficial for the people as it give them the idea according to their symptoms whether they are at risk or have to consult doctor or it is a normal problem.
•	It is beneficial for the people in saving their money as for the common disease they have to spend their lot of time and money.
•	It is also beneficial for the government as they have to examine high risk people only .

# TOOLS USED -  
•	Jupyter Notebook.
•	Python Libraries.
•	Python Tkinter tools.
•	Datasets for the specific disease.



# METHADOLOGY FOLLOWED-

•	In the first step we have to import all the packagesrequired like Tkinter for GUI, numpy,pandas etc..
•	Then we have to import all datasets which are present in .csv format.
•	Then we create the Main GUI window which have the options for which disease we have to check.
•	Then for all the disease specified in the options in the Main window we have to make new window and perform operations on the symptoms.
•	Then according to the symptoms we predict the result using different algorithms.
•	To exit we have the button by which we can come out of the process.




# Algorithms Used-
•	Decision Tree- It is classified as very effective and versatile classification technique and used for the complex problems due to its high adaptability. I used this algorithm for prediction of the common disease.
•	Logistic Regression- It is a static analysis and used to predict a binary outcome such as yes or no based on prior observations of data set. I used this algorithm in predicting heart and covid 19 disease .
